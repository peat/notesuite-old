## NoteSuite

I don't expect this to be particularly useful to anyone else, but if by chance you happen to be a web developer who
also collects world banknotes ... this might be right up your alley! The goal of NoteSuite is to simply track all of
the data in my collection, so that I can more easily figure out what I have and what I'm missing.

What this repository is missing is my data ... if you're really interested in what I have, drop me a line and we can
nerd out!

A couple quick notes:

* This app was ported from Rails 1.2 ... so watch out for little pockets of old skool.
* There's a hot little form builder in `helpers/application_form_builder.rb` ... check out some of the form ERB, and
then see how it renders in the browser. Neat, 'eh?

Thanks for playing.
